CSS Inheritance
    Child elements inherit properties from parents. Set properties on high-level elements

Cascade:
    Rules that come later override earlier ones
    Rules that are more specific override more general ones

Selectors:
    Search al elements for a match
    if it finds a match, rules take effect
    Look up a list of selectors to find how to make different types of selections. Like children, sudo classes, etc 

Normal Flow:
    All elements are rectangles (called box model), laid out in sequence, from top to bottom, left to right
    Padding is on inside of border, margin is on outside
    
    display: block; Stacked rectangles
    display: inline; Rectangles next to eachother

CSS Positioning:
    Static
    Relative
    Absolute
    Fixed
