This page uses JavaScript to allow a user to play rock paper scissors. The code randomly generates a choice that is compared to the user's choice. The site displays the winner, and updates a scoreboard (which can be reset using the reset button).

This project was made for COMM 329, to get more familiar with JS. I've found JS less difficult to pick up than I expected, because it reminds me of C++.

One noticable improvement from the demo code we saw at the beginning of the project is the use of switches, instead of if statements, for the game's logic. This improves the readability of the code, and simplifies the logic. This might be a good thing to include in the demo code for future students who don't have experience using switches.
