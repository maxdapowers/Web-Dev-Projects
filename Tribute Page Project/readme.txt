Tribute Page Project:
Personal Training Website for Brian Dobens (Mock)
Submitted October 6, 2022

Backstory:
This summer I spent many nights at my local gym, where I'm pretty close with most of the staff and members. I noticed a new trainer, and introduced myself. We spent a while talking, and it wasn't long before Brian and I worked out together. I realized how much he knew about fitness and how much I had to learn from him. Over the course of the summer he taught me a ton, purely because he's so passionate about health and fitness. He's been telling me about his issues with the management at our gym, so he's been trying to get things together and start his own independent training business. We've talked about me helping him with a website, and although this won't be the one I make for him, I thought it'd be a good subject for this project.
